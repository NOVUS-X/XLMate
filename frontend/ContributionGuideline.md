XLMate Contribution Rules 🎸
**What you should know**
This project currently has no design, and we need a UI/UX-focused developer to take ownership of the frontend experience. The ideal contributor should have a strong understanding of design principles, user experience, and modern frontend development.
**What’s Needed?**
UI/UX Design: Conceptualizing a clean, user-friendly interface from scratch.
Frontend Development: Implementing the design using a modern tech stack (Nextjs Tailwind, shadcn etc.).
Collaboration: Open to feedback and iteration to refine the experience.
If you’re a design-driven frontend engineer who enjoys crafting intuitive, visually appealing UIs, this place is for you. A strong sense of aesthetics and attention to detail are key.
Lastly: Always ensure to create a new branch before making changes.
